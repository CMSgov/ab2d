## Overview

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is developing a standards-based 
Application Programming Interface (API) to provide PDP sponsors with Medicare Parts A and B claims 
data for their enrollees. Consistent with CMSâ€™ Final Rule to implement Section 50354 of the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, CMS will be providing standalone Medicare Part D plan (PDP) sponsors
the opportunity to request access to Medicare claims data beginning in 2020. Access to Medicare 
claims data for their enrollees will help plans promote the appropriate use of medications and 
improve health outcomes, among other benefits.

## Attestation

Beginning in January 2020, PDP sponsors may request Medicare claims data via the Claim Data Attestation module in 
the Health Plan Management System (HPMS). This attestation process ensures that PDP sponsors are aware of how 
they may or may not use the Medicare claims data, including the limitations associated with the reuse and redisclosure 
of the data.
