## Overview

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is developing a standards-based 
Application Programming Interface (API) to provide PDP sponsors with Medicare Parts A and B claims 
data for their enrollees. Consistent with CMS’ 
[Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/04/16/2019-06822/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-policy-and-technical-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-medicare#page-15745)
to implement Section 50354 of the 
[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892/text), 
CMS is providing standalone Medicare Part D plan (PDP) sponsors
the opportunity to request access to Medicare claims data. Access to Medicare
claims data for their enrollees will help plans promote the appropriate use of medications and 
improve health outcomes, among other benefits.

## Attestation

PDP sponsors may request Medicare claims data via the Claims Data Attestation module in
the Health Plan Management System (HPMS). This attestation process ensures that PDP sponsors are aware of how 
they may or may not use the Medicare claims data, including the limitations associated with the reuse and redisclosure 
of the data. Visit [HPMS](https://hpms.cms.gov)
