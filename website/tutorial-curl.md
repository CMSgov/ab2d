## AB2D Synthetic Data

AB2D provides four sample contracts that have been designed to provide synthetic data for testing purposes.

**Simple Datasets- Two Contracts**

This dataset provides contracts with a varying number of beneficiaries containing simple approximations of AB2D data. 
These contracts are ideal to test the stress of retrieving and downloading different sized data files. The data in these 
API payloads will not reflect the distribution of disease and demographic information you can expect from production data.

   <table class="ds-c-table">
      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Sponsor</th>
            <th>Contract</th>
            <th>Number of Benes</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <th>PDP-100</th>
            <th>Z0000</th>
            <th>100</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <th>PDP-10000</th>
            <th>Z0010</th>
            <th>10,000</th>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
<br/>

**Advanced Datasets- Two Contracts**

This dataset provides contracts with sample data that is a more accurate representation of AB2D production data. They 
follow AB2Dâ€™s Bulk FHIR format and contain a more realistic distribution of disease and demographic information.

  <table class="ds-c-table">
      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Sponsor</th>
            <th>Contract</th>
            <th>Number of Benes</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <th>PDP-1001</th>
            <th>Z1001</th>
            <th>600-800</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <th>PDP-1002</th>
            <th>Z1002</th>
            <th>600-800</th>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
<br/>

## Prerequisites &amp; Caveats

associated with your machine.

## Retrieve JSON Web Token

1. Note that there are 4 users (clients) setup in the sandbox

   <table class="ds-c-table">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Dataset Type</th>
         <th>Sponsor</th>
         <th>Contract</th>
         <th>Client ID</th>
         <th>Client Password</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>Simple</td>
         <td>PDP-100</td>
         <td>Z0000</td>
         <td>0oa2t0lsrdZw5uWRx297</td>
         <td>HHduWG6LogIvDIQuWgp3Zlo9OYMValTtH5OBcuHw</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>Simple</td>
         <td>PDP-10000</td>
         <td>Z0010</td>
         <td>0oa2t0lm9qoAtJHqC297</td>
         <td>ybR60JmtcpRt6SAeLmvbq6l-3YDRCZP-WN1At6t_</td>
       </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Advanced</td>
         <td>PDP-1001</td>
         <td>Z1001</td>
         <td>0oa9jyx2w9Z0AntLE297</td>
         <td>hskbPu-YoWfGDY1gcQq34BfIEyMVuayu87zWDliG</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Advanced</td>
         <td>PDP-1002</td>
         <td>Z1002</td>
         <td>0oa9jz0e1dyNfRMm6297</td>
         <td>GkHcu29ptDsKKRW6q5uFJSSpIpdl_K5fVW</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>

2. Note the basic authorization encoded user names and passwords for each of those 5 users are included below for convenience

   *The "Base64-encoded id:password" values in the table below were created using the following command.*
   
   ```
   AUTH=$(echo -n "${OKTA_CLIENT_ID}:${OKTA_CLIENT_PASSWORD}" | base64)
   ```

   <table class="ds-c-table">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Sponsor</th>
         <th>Base64-encoded id:password</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>0oa2t0lsrdZw5uWRx297</td>
         <td>MG9hMnQwbHNyZFp3NXVXUngyOTc6SEhkdVdHNkxvZ0l2RElRdVdncDNabG85T1lNVmFsVHRINU9CY3VIdw==</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>0oa2t0lm9qoAtJHqC297</td>
         <td>MG9hMnQwbG05cW9BdEpIcUMyOTc6eWJSNjBKbXRjcFJ0NlNBZUxtdmJxNmwtM1lEUkNaUC1XTjFBdDZ0Xw==</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>0oa9jyx2w9Z0AntLE297</td>
         <td>MG9hOWp5eDJ3OVowQW50TEUyOTc6aHNrYlB1LVlvV2ZHRFkxZ2NRcTM0QmZJRXlNVnVheXU4N3pXRGxpRw==</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>0oa9jz0e1dyNfRMm6297</td><td>MG9hOWp6MGUxZHlOZlJNbTYyOTc6c2huRzZOR2tIY3UyOXB0RHNLS1JXNnE1dUZKU1NwSXBkbF9LNWZWVw==</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>

3. Choose the desired user to test. The first user has the least data, the second the most and the last two use Synthea data.

4. Open a new terminal

5. Set the authorization for the desired user in the format:

   ```AUTH={basic authorization}```

   Example for the user 0oa2t0lsrdZw5uWRx297:

   ```AUTH=MG9hMnQwbHNyZFp3NXVXUngyOTc6SEhkdVdHNkxvZ0l2RElRdVdncDNabG85T1lNVmFsVHRINU9CY3VIdw==```

6. Retrieve the JWT bearer token by entering the following at the terminal prompt:

   ```
   BEARER_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "https://test.idp.idm.cms.gov/oauth2/aus2r7y3gdaFMKBol297/v1/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scope=clientCreds" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic ${AUTH}" \
     | jq --raw-output ".access_token")
   ```

   You will need this "BEARER_TOKEN" environment variable in order to do any of the following sections. All commands should
   be in this same terminal window since the value of the environment variable is only set in that terminal.

   The bearer token will expire in 1 hour.

## Request Data

In this section, you will initiate a Part A & B bulk explanation of benefit export job.

<i style="font-size: small">Note to Windows users - When you are instructed to "open a terminal", the instructions are assuming that you are
opening ubuntu or some other terminal that supports curl and jq. See [Windows 10 Setup information](setup-windows.html).</i>

1. Open a terminal

2. Create a new JWT bearer token before proceeding if any of the following are true:

   - bearer token environment variables does not exist
    
   - bearer token is older than 1 hour (expired)
    
   - bearer token was created with a user different than the user that you want to use
    
3. Ensure that you have a "BEARER_TOKEN" environment variable defined before proceeding:

   ```
   echo $BEARER_TOKEN
   ```
    
4. Create an export job

   <i>Note that the $ in $export is escaped</i>

   ```
   curl "https://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Patient/\$export?_outputFormat=application%2Ffhir%2Bndjson&_type=ExplanationOfBenefit" \
     -sD - \
     -H "accept: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/fhir+json" \
     -H "Prefer: respond-async" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}"
   ```

   You should get a response that looks like this:

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 {response code}
   Content-Location: https://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Job/{job id}/$status
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
   Pragma: no-cache
   Expires: 0
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   Content-Length: 0
   Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2020 15:28:06 GMT
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   HTTP/2 202 
   date: Tue, 03 Mar 2020 21:08:36 GMT
   content-length: 0
   content-location: http://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Job/c40e30e6-0913-4803-9b05-bb0563f0cac6/$status
   x-content-type-options: nosniff
   x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
   cache-control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
   pragma: no-cache
   expires: 0
   x-frame-options: DENY
   ```

   Note the response and job id from the output
   
   Example:

   ```
   {response-code} = 202 
   {job id} = c40e30e6-0913-4803-9b05-bb0563f0cac6
   ``` 
    
5. Below are the possible response codes:

   <table class="ds-c-table">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Response Code</th>
         <th>Description</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>202</td>
         <td>Export request has started</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>400</td>
         <td>There was a problem with the request. The body will contain a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in JSON format. https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html Please refer to the body of the response for details.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>401</td>
         <td>Unauthorized. Missing authentication token. </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>403</td>
         <td>Forbidden. Access not permitted.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>500</td>
         <td>An error occurred. The body will contain a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in JSON format. https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html Please refer to the body of the response for details.</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>

6. If the response code is 202, set an environment variable for the job by entering the following at the terminal prompt

   Format:

   ```
   JOB={job id}
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   JOB=c40e30e6-0913-4803-9b05-bb0563f0cac6
   ```
    
7. Check the status of the job by entering the following at the terminal prompt

   Notice that the $ in $status is escaped.

   ```
   curl "https://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Job/${JOB}/\$status" \
     -sD - \
     -H "accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}"
   ```
   
8. Note the output

   Format:

   ```
   HTTP/2 {response code}
   date: Tue, 03 Mar 2020 22:48:36 GMT
   content-type: application/json
   expires: Wed, 4 Mar 2020 22:47:24 GMT
   x-content-type-options: nosniff
   x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
   x-frame-options: DENY
   vary: accept-encoding

   {"transactionTime":"Mar 3, 2020, 10:47:24 PM","request":"http://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Patient/$export?_outputFormat=application%252Ffhir%252Bndjson&_type=ExplanationOfBenefit","requiresAccessToken":true,"output":[{"type":"ExplanationOfBenefit","url":"http://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Job/{job id}/file/{file to download}"}],"error":[]}
   ```

   If the job is still processing, it will return a 202 and a percent complete:

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 202 
   X-Progress: 20% complete
   Retry-After: 5
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
   Pragma: no-cache
   Expires: 0
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   Content-Length: 0
   Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2020 19:14:56 GMT
   ```

   If the job is complete, it will return a 200: It will also display the location of the file(s) created for the batch job.

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 
   Expires: Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:28:27 GMT
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   vary: accept-encoding
   Content-Type: application/json
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked
   Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2020 16:04:47 GMT
   {
       "transactionTime":"Jan 29, 2020, 10:28:27 AM",
       "request":"https://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Patient/$export?_outputFormat=application%252Ffhir%252Bndjson&_type=ExplanationOfBenefit",
       "requiresAccessToken":true,
       "output":[
           {
               "type":"ExplanationOfBenefit",
               "url":"https://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Job/5298026c-e503-4d93-9974-c7732f56a0f8/file/Z0000_0001.ndjson"
           }
       ],
       "error":[]
   }
   ```

   The JSON (formated here for readability) will contain the location of the files in the .output[].url values. Z0001 indicates the contract number, 0001 indicates the file for that contract number. If the contract is big enough that breaking it into parts is warranted, you might see Z0001_00002.ndjson, for example.

9. Note the response code and file to download from the output

   Example:

   ```
   {response code} = 200
   {file to download} = Z0000_0001.ndjson
   ```

   The following are the possible response codes

   <table class="ds-c-table">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Response Code</th>
         <th>Description</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tr>
       <td>200</td><td>The job is completed.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>202</td><td>The job is still in progress.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>400</td>
       <td>There was a problem with the request. The body will contain a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in 
           JSON format. https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html Please refer to the body of the response for details.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>401</td>
       <td>Unauthorized. Missing authentication token.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>403</td>
       <td>Forbidden. Access not permitted.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>404</td>
       <td>Job not found. The body will contain a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in JSON format. 
           https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html Please refer to the body of the response for details.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>500</td>
       <td>An error occurred. The body will contain a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in JSON format. 
           https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html Please refer to the body of the response for details.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

10. If the status is 202, do the following

    a. Note the following in the output, for example:

       ```
       x-progress: 7% complete
       ```

    b. Based on the progress, you can a wait a period of time and try the status check again until you see a status of 200

11. If the status is 200, download the files by doing the following:

    a. Set an environment variable to the first file to download

       Format:

       ```
       FILE={file to download}
       ```

       Example:

       ```
       FILE=Z0000_0001.ndjson
       ```

    b. Get the Part A & B bulk claim export data by entering the following at the terminal prompt

       ```
       curl "https://sandbox.ab2d.cms.gov/api/v1/fhir/Job/${JOB}/file/${FILE}" \
         -H "Accept: application/fhir+ndjson" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}" \
         > ${FILE}
       ```

    c. Wait for the process to complete

    d. The following file has been created in your current directory

       Format:

       ```
       {file to download}
       ```

       Example:

       ```
       Z0000_0001.ndjson
       ```

    e. Verify that there is data in the file by entering the following at the terminal prompt

       Format:

       ```
       cat {file to download}
       ```

       Example:

       ```
       cat Z0000_0001.ndjson
       ``` 

    f. Repeat this process to download additional files (if any)

    g. After the file has been downloaded for a given job, it can't be downloaded again using the same job. 
    If you want to download the data again, a new export job would need to be initiated
