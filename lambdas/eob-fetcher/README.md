# This lambda is a work in progress 
Interfacing with BFD to fetch EoBs is a time-consuming and computationally expensive process. The current monolithic approach with reserved AWS instances works but it's wasteful. 
Moving to lambdas
- saves money
- potentially improves reliability
- Allows for easier scalability
