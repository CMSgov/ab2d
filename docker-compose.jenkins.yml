# Overrides specific properties of original compose for CI environment
# * Changes user from root to Jenkins to prevent issues with file permissions on server
# * Forces api and worker to wait for the postgres database to fully initialize before querying
# * Overrides the directory tmp-volume maps to on the file system with an environment variable because each branch
#   in Jenkins has a separate directory and must be isolated from other concurrently running jobs on the file system
