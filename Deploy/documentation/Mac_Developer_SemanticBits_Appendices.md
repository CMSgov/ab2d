## Appendix A: PostgreSQL 11

### Install PostgreSQL 11

1. Change the ownership of "openssl@1.1"

   ```ShellSession
   $ sudo chown -R $(whoami) "/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@1.1"
   ```

1. Install PostgreSQL 11

   ```ShellSession
   $ brew install postgresql@11
   ```

1. Note the following caveats

   ```
   ==> Caveats
   ==> openssl@1.1
   A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
   keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
     /usr/local/etc/openssl@1.1/certs

   and run
     /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin/c_rehash

   openssl@1.1 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
   because macOS provides LibreSSL.

   If you need to have openssl@1.1 first in your PATH run:
     echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/lonnie.hanekamp/.bash_profile

   For compilers to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"

   For pkg-config to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"

   ==> readline
   readline is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
   because macOS provides BSD libedit.

   For compilers to find readline you may need to set:
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/readline/include"

   For pkg-config to find readline you may need to set:
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib/pkgconfig"

   ==> postgresql@11
   To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:
     brew postgresql-upgrade-database

   postgresql@11 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
   because this is an alternate version of another formula.

   If you need to have postgresql@11 first in your PATH run:
     echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@11/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/lonnie.hanekamp/.bash_profile

   For compilers to find postgresql@11 you may need to set:
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@11/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@11/include"

   For pkg-config to find postgresql@11 you may need to set:
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@11/lib/pkgconfig"


   To have launchd start postgresql@11 now and restart at login:
     brew services start postgresql@11
   Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
     pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@11 start
   ```

1. Add PostgreSQL bin to your path

   ```ShellSession
   $ printf '\n# Add PostgreSQL to Path' >> ~/.bash_profile
   $ printf '\nexport PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@11/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

1. Start PostgreSQL service

   ```ShellSession
   $ brew services start postgresql@11
   ```

1. Ensure that PostgreSQL is running on port 5432

   ```ShellSession
   $ netstat -an | grep 5432
   ```
   
### Uninstall PostgreSQL 11

1. Stop PostgreSQL service

   ```ShellSession
   $ brew services stop postgresql
   ```

1. Install PostgreSQL 11

   ```ShellSession
   $ brew uninstall postgresql@11
   ```

1. Ensure that PostgreSQL is no longer running on port 5432

   ```ShellSession
   $ netstat -an | grep 5432
   ```
